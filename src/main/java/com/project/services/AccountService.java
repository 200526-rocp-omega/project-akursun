//this design is simply furthering same design structure that we have used up to now
//how you go about designing the details of this layer is up to you
//due to the nature of the "business logic" being rather arbitrary
//this layer has the MOST creativity involved....most other layers are pretty boiler plate
//where you copy and paste most methods
